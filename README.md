# CNC_MillingMachine_Production_-DataSet_Analysis
The given dataset was a dataset of the power consumption of a programmable CNC milling  machine with the process features.
CNC machining is used in many industries, including automotive, medical, aerospace, gas and 
oil, and warehouse operations, because it eliminates manual labor, saving time and making 
production processes more efficient. Any machine, molded part, or product you see in use was 
almost certainly created using CNC machining. Given the increased use of CNC machining, it's 
no surprise that industries are recognizing the high accuracy, short production times, and power 
savings that CNC operations can provide.
Manufacturing is a major polluter, accounting for more than 30% of primary energy 
consumption. As a result, energy efficiency must be prioritized, and the energy demand of a 
machining strategy must be predicted prior to the manufacturing of a part. CNC machine 
tools, as the primary energy-consuming equipment in the manufacturing industry, have 
characteristics such as large quantity and range, high total energy consumption, and low 
efficiency, among others, and have a high potential for energy savings. As a result, accurately 
and quickly predicting its machining energy consumption is an effective way to achieve optimal 
energy management.
Controllable processing times are especially important during this economic downturn because 
they enable businesses to better adjust production resources to meet deadlines. These 
processing times on a CNC machine are determined by machining conditions, which we can 
change to increase or decrease the processing time of a job since customers prefer consistent 
delivery times that fit their schedules.
From the supply chain to the finished and installed part, incremental optimization will be at the 
heart of future manufacturing work. There is an opportunity to use data to truly understand what 
is going on during manufacturing process and make better decisions with machine learning and 
big data tools. The adoption of predictive models in the industrial sector promises to 
significantly increase operational effectiveness.
